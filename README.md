# syndicated.media

syndicated.media is a working group intended to develop or improve standards related to media content. Currently the focus is on audio and video content distributed through [podcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) via [RSS](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html).

The goal of this working group is to create useful, highly-adopted, well-defined additions to the existing RSS system, as well as establish standards for other technological aspects that impact podcasting, including host and client behavior, analytics, and monetization. The entirety of these standards and best practices are considered the _syndicated.media specification_, and may include conformance to other specs, including those defined by this working group.

The remainder of this document is a work-in-progress draft of the _syndicated.media specification_.

## Goals

The primary goals of this spec are to improve the quality of podcasting as a method of distribution for those who have a stake in the content. Including:

* Producers
* Publishers
* Consumers (listeners, viewers, etc)
* Developers
* Studios
* Sponsors
* Underwriters
* Advertisers

The hope is to make improvements without sacrificing or diminishing core concepts and values of podcasting, such as its distributed and decentralized nature.
